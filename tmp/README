1. Introduction
---------------

PFDS  is a  set of  purely functional  data structures  written in  R6RS
Scheme.  It contains:

- queues
- deques
- bbtrees
- sets
- dlists
- priority search queues (psqs)
- finger trees
- sequences
- heaps

  This  package is  just  a repackaging  of Ian  Price's  PFDS with  GNU
Autotools  for package  infrastructure and  verified support  for Vicare
Scheme.

  *NOTE*  The  maintainer of  this  repackaging  supports only  the  GNU
infrastructure and tests only on a GNU+Linux system.


2. License
----------

See the LICENSE file.


3. Install
----------

Before installing  PFDS make sure  to have a correctly  installed Vicare
Scheme.

  To install  PFDS from  a proper  release tarball,  we must  unpack the
archive then do:

   $ cd pfds-0.4.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

notice  that  the  "configure"  script  is  prepared  to  enable  shared
libraries  and  disable static  libraries:  this  must not  be  changed,
because  the package  is  meant to  install  a C  shared  library to  be
dynamically loaded.

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/pfds

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd pfds
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the programs "autoreconf".

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  Libraries are installed under the directory:

			$(libdir)/vicare-scheme

on 32-bit platforms we should arrange such library to be:

		      $(prefix)/lib/vicare-scheme

on 64-bit platforms we should arrange such library to be:

		     $(prefix)/lib64/vicare-scheme

  The variable VFLAGS is available  to the user when running "configure"
and "make" to add command line options to the execution of "vicare" when
compiling libraries and running tests; for example:

   $ make VFLAGS="-g -O2 --option print-loaded-libraries"


4. Usage
