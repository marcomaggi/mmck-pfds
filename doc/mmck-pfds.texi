@cindex Library @library{mmck pfds}


This document describes version @value{VERSION} of @value{PACKAGE}, a set of @chicken{} language
libraries implementing purely functional data structures.  @chicken{} is a Scheme--to--C compiler
supporting the language features as defined in the ``Revised^5 Report on Scheme''.

This package supports @posix{} platforms.  This package depends upon the @chicken{} egg
@code{coops}.  To run the tests distributed with the source code: this package depends upon the
package @mmck{} Checks.

The package installs the library @library{mmck pfds} along with its import library.  To require the
library and import its syntactic bindings in a module we can do:

@example
(declare (unit my-module)
         (emit-import-library my-module))

(require-library (mmck pfds))

(module (my-module)
    ()
  (import (scheme)
    (mmck pfds))

  ...

  #| end of module |# )

@node dlists
@chapter Difference Lists


Repeatedly appending to a list is a common, if inefficient pattern in functional programs.  Usually
the trick we use is to build up the list in reverse, and then to reverse it as the last action of a
function.  Dlists are a representation of lists as functions that provide for constant time append
to either the front or end of a dlist that may be used instead.


@defun dlist @var{obj} @dots{}
Return a dlist containing all the given arguments.
@end defun

@node psqs
@chapter Priority search queues


Priority search queues are a combination of two common abstract data types: finite maps, and
priority queues.  As such, it provides for access, insertion, removal and update on arbitrary keys,
as well as for easy removal of the element with the lowest priority.

Where a procedure takes a key or priority these are expected to be compatible with the relevant
ordering procedures on the psq.

@defun psq-update @var{psq} @var{key} @var{priority-update} @var{priority}
Return the priority search queue obtained by modifying the priority of @var{key}, by the given

@c page
@node fingertrees
@chapter A simple general--purpose data structure


Fingertrees are a generalised form of deque, that we can parametrise to compute a value, called the
``measure'' of a fingertree.  This measure will be updated incrementally as we add and remove
elements from the fingertree.  Among other things, this allows fingertrees to be used where you
otherwise might have written a custom data structure.

To compute the measure, fingertrees require pieces of information: a converter, a combiner, and an
identity.

@itemize
@item
The @dfn{converter} is a procedure of one argument, that maps values in the fingertree to other
values which are used for computing the measure.

@item
The @dfn{combiner} is a procedure of two arguments, and combines these into one value representing
them both.  A combiner must be associative i.e.

@example
(combine A (combine B C)) @equiv{} (combine (combine A B) C)
@end example

@noindent
for all values @code{A}, @code{B} and @code{C}.

@item
An @dfn{identity} is a value that represents the measure of an empty fingertree.  It must obey the
rule that @code{(combine X identity)}, @code{(combine identity X)} and @code{X} are always the same.
@end itemize

To make things more concrete, a simple use of a fingertree is as a deque that keeps a running total.
In this case, the converter can simply be the function @code{(lambda (x) x)} if it is a deque of
integers, the combiner would be @func{+}, and the identity @code{0}.

@example
(define l '(3 1 4 1 5 9))

(define ft (list->fingertree l 0 + (lambda (x) x)))

(fingertree-measure ft)
@result{} 23

(fingertree-measure (fingertree-snoc ft 2))
@result{} 25

(let-values (((head tail) (fingertree-uncons ft)))
  (fingertree-measure tail))
@result{} 20
@end example

Mathematically speaking, the @strong{return type} of the converter, the combiner and the identity
element are expected to form a monoid.


@defun make-fingertree @var{identity} @var{combine} @var{measure}
Return a new fingertree, parametrised by the given monoid.

raised.
@end defun


@defun fingertree-unsnoc @var{fingertree}
Return 2 values: a new fingertree containing all but the rear element of @var{fingertree}, and the
rear element itself.  If @var{fingertree} is empty: a @condition{fingertree-empty} condition is
raised.
@end defun


@defun fingertree-empty-condition? @var{condition}
Return @true{} if the argument is a @condition{fingertree-empty} condition, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun


@defun fingertree-append @vari{fingertree} @varii{fingertree}
Return a new fingertree which contains all of the elements of @vari{fingertree}, followed by all the
elements of @varii{fingertree}.  The arguments are assumed to be parametrised by the same monoid.
@end defun

Return a fingertree containing all of the elements of the list argument, in the same order.
@end defun


@defun fingertree->list @var{fingertree}

applying the @var{predicate} to it's accumulated measure returns @false{}; is a new fingertree
containing all those elements not in the first fingertree.

@var{predicate} must be a function accepting a single argument and returning a boolean.
@end defun


@defun fingertree-split3 @var{predicate} @var{fingertree}
Similar to @func{fingertree-split}, however, instead of returning the remainder as the second
argument, return the head of the remainder as second value, and tail of the remainder as third
value.

@defun fingertree-fold @var{combiner} @var{accum-base} @var{fingertree}
Return the value obtained by iterating the @var{combiner} procedure over @var{fingertree} in
left--to--right order.  This procedure takes two arguments: the current value from @var{fingertree},
and an accumulator; it's return value is used as accumulator for the next iteration.  The initial
value for the accumulator is given by the base argument.
@end defun


@defun fingertree-fold-right @var{combiner} @var{fingertree}

Return 2 new sequences: the first containing the first @var{N} items of @var{sequence}, the second
containing the remaining items.  If @var{N} is negative: return the empty sequence as the first
value, and the original sequence as the second value.  Similarly, if @var{N} is greater than the
size of @var{sequence}: return the original sequence as the first value, and the empty sequence as
the second value.

Consequently:

@example
(let-values (((a b) (sequence-split-at SEQ N)))
  (sequence-append a b))
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to @var{SEQ} for all sequences @var{SEQ}, and integers @var{N}.
@end defun


@defun sequence-take @var{sequence} @var{N}
Return a new sequence containing the first @var{N} items of @var{sequence}.  If @var{N} is negative:
the empty sequence is returned.  If @var{N} is larger than the size of @var{sequence}: the whole
sequence is returned.
@end defun


@defun sequence-drop @var{sequence} @var{N}
Return a new sequence containing all but the first @var{N} items of @var{sequence}.  If @var{N} is
negative: the whole sequence is returned.  If @var{N} is larger than the size of @var{sequence}: the
empty sequence is returned.
@end defun


@defun sequence-ref @var{sequence} @var{index}
Return the item at the specified @var{index} in the sequence; @var{index} must be a non--negative
exact integer.  If @var{index} is outside the range:

@example
0 <= @var{index} < (sequence-size @var{sequence})
@end example

@noindent
an assertion violation is raised.
@end defun


@defun sequence-set @var{sequence} @var{index} @var{item}
Return the new sequence obtained by replacing the item at the specified @var{index} in
@var{sequence} with the given @var{item}.  If @var{index} is outside the range:

@example
0 <= @var{index} < (sequence-size @var{sequence})
@end example

@noindent
an assertion violation is raised.
@end defun


@defun sequence-fold @var{combiner} @var{accum-base} @var{sequence}
Return the value obtained by iterating the @var{combiner} procedure over @var{sequence} in
left--to--right order.  The @var{combiner} procedure takes two arguments: the value of the position
in the sequence, and an accumulator, and its return value is used as the value of the accumulator
for the next call.  The initial accumulator value is given by the @var{accum-base} argument.
@end defun


@defun sequence-fold-right @var{combiner} @var{accum-base} @var{sequence}
Like @func{sequence-fold}, but the sequence is traversed in right--to--left order, rather than
left--to--right.
@end defun


@defun sequence-reverse @var{sequence}
Return a new sequence containing all the item of @var{sequence}, in reverse order.
@end defun


@defun sequence-map @var{mapper} @var{sequence}

in turn.
@end defun


@defun sequence-filter @var{predicate} @var{sequence}
Return a new sequence containing all the items of @var{sequence} for which the @var{predicate} is
true.

The following conventions for function arguments hold:

@table @var
@item bbtree
It is the instance of bbtree the function acts upon.  Bbtree arguments are @strong{never} mutated.

@item key
The argument is an association key.  For all procedures which take a @var{key} as an argument, the
@var{key} must be comparable with the ordering procedure of the bbtree.

@item item<
The argument @var{item<} must be the ordering procedure: a predicate function accepting two
arguments and returning a boolean, @true{} if the first argument is strictly less than the second.
For numeric collected items: @var{item<} can be @func{<}; for string collected items: @var{item<}
can be @func{string<?}.
@end table

@node bbtrees core
@section Constructors and predicates


@defun make-bbtree @var{item<}

argument @var{item<} for ordering keys.
@end defun


@defun bbtree? @var{any}
Return @true{} if the argument is a bbtree, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun


@defun bbtree->alist @var{bbtree}
Return the key/value associations from @var{bbtree} as a list of pairs.  The list returned is in
sorted order according to the ordering procedure of @var{bbtree}.  A consequence of this is that one
could write a sort procedure for lists of pairs as:

@example
(define (alist-sort alist <)
  (bbtree->alist (alist->bbtree alist <)))
@end example
@end defun


@defun alist->bbtree @var{alist} @var{item<}
Return the bbtree containing each of the key/value pairs in @var{alist}, using the @var{item<}
argument as the ordering procedure.

@example
(alist->bbtree '(("foo" . 10) ("bar" . 12))
               string<?)

@defunx bbtree-ref @var{bbtree} @var{key} @var{default}
Return the value associated with the @var{key} in the @var{bbtree}.  If the value is not in the
tree, then, if the optional third argument is passed, it is returned, otherwise raise a condition
with kind @code{pfds-assertion-violation}.
@end defun


@defun bbtree-set @var{bbtree} @var{key} @var{new-value}
Return a new bbtree with @var{key} associated to @var{new-value}.  If the @var{key} is already in
@var{bbtree}, its associated value is replaced with the new @var{new-value} in the returned bbtree.
@end defun


@defun bbtree-update @var{bbtree} @var{key} @var{proc} @var{default}
Return a new bbtree with the value associated to @var{key} updated according to the update procedure
@var{proc}.  If @var{key} was not already in @var{bbtree}, the update procedure is applied to
@var{default}, and @var{key} is associated to the resulting value.

The update procedure @var{proc} must accept a single argument, being the old value, and return a
single value, being the new value.

@example
(let* ((bb1   (alist->bbtree '(("foo" . 10)
                               ("bar" . 12))
                             string<?))
       (dflt  0)
       (bb2   (bbtree-update bb1 "foo" add1 dflt)))
  (bbtree->alist bb2))
@result{} (("bar" . 12) ("foo" . 11))

(let* ((bb1  (alist->bbtree '(("foo" . 10)
                              ("bar" . 12))
                            string<?))
       (dflt 0)

@result{} (("bar" . 12) ("baz" . 1) ("foo" . 10))
@end example
@end defun


@defun bbtree-delete @var{bbtree} @var{key}
Return a new bbtree with the @var{key} and its associated value removed.  If @var{key} is not in
@var{bbtree}: the returned bbtree is a copy of the original.
@end defun

@c page
@node bbtrees traversing
@section Traversing functions


@defun bbtree-traverse @var{traverser} @var{accum-base} @var{bbtree}
A general tree traversal procedure.  Return the value of applying the @var{traverser} procedure to:
the current node's key, the current node's value, a procedure to traverse the left subtree, a
procedure to traverse the right subtree, and an accumulator value.

The @var{traverser} procedure must look like:

@example
(define (traverser key value left-traverse right-traverse accum)
  ---)
@end example

@noindent
and return the new accumulator value.  The subtree traversal procedures are generated by
@func{bbtree-traverse}; both take the current accumulator value as argument, return the new
accumulator value, and call @func{bbtree-traverse} recursively on the appropriate subtree.
@var{traverser} must call both @var{left-traverse} and @var{right-traverse}:

@itemize
@item
If @var{left-traverse} is called first: the left subtree is visited first.

@item
If @var{right-traverse} is called first: the right subtree is visited first.
@end itemize

To perform a left--first preorder iteration:

@example
(let ((bb (alist->bbtree (map (lambda (x) (cons x x))
                           '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
                         <)))
  (define (left-first key value left right accum)
    (right (left (cons key accum))))
  (bbtree-traverse left-first '() bb))
@result{} (9 8 6 7 4 5 2 0 1 3)
@end example

@noindent
and to perform a right--first preorder iteration:

@example
(let ((bb (alist->bbtree (map (lambda (x) (cons x x))
                           '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
                         <)))
  (define (right-first key value left right accum)
    (left (right (cons key accum))))
  (bbtree-traverse right-first '() bb))
@result{} (0 2 1 4 6 9 8 7 5 3)
@end example

This function is mostly useful for implementing other, more specific tree traversal procedures.  For
example:

@example
(define (l-to-r-pre-order cons base bbtree)
  (bbtree-traverse (lambda (key value left right accum)
                     (right (left (cons* key value accum))))
                   accum
                   bbtree))
@end example

@noindent
implements a left--to--right pre--order traversal variant of @func{bbtree-fold}.
@end defun


@defun bbtree-fold @var{combine} @var{accum-base} @var{bbtree}
Return the value obtained by iterating the @var{combine} procedure over each node in the tree.  The
combine procedure takes 3 arguments: the key and value of the current node, and an accumulator
value; its return value is used as the accumulator value for the next node.  The initial accumulator
value is provided by the @var{accum-base} argument.

@func{bbtree-fold} performs a left--to--right in--order traversal or ``minimum key to maximum key''.

@example
(let ((bb (alist->bbtree (map (lambda (x) (cons x x))
                           '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
                         <)))
  ;;Later keys are pushed on the head.
  (bbtree-fold (lambda (key value accum)
                 (cons key accum))
               '()
               bb))
@result{} (9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0)
@end example
@end defun


@defun bbtree-fold-right @var{combine} @var{accum-base} @var{bbtree}
Like @func{bbtree-fold}, but it performs a right--to--left in--order traversal instead (i.e. maximum
to minimum).

@example
(let ((bb (alist->bbtree (map (lambda (x) (cons x x))
                           '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
                         <)))
  ;;Later keys are pushed on the head.
  (bbtree-fold-right (lambda (key value accum)
                       (cons key accum))
                     '()
                     bb))
@result{} (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
@end example
@end defun


@defun bbtree-map @var{func} @var{bbtree}
Return a new bbtree obtained by updating the value of each node in @var{bbtree} with the result of
applying the procedure to its value.  @var{func} must take a single argument, being the original
value, and return a single value, being the new value.

@example
(define bb
  (alist->bbtree '((#\a . foo)
                   (#\b . bar)
                   (#\c . baz)
                   (#\d . quux))
                 char<?))

(bbtree->alist (bbtree-map symbol->string bb))
@result{} ((#\a . "foo")
    (#\b . "bar")
    (#\c . "baz")
    (#\d . "quux"))
@end example

associations in @var{bbtree}.
@end defun


@defun bbtree-ref/index @var{bbtree} @var{index}
Return 2 values: the key and value of the association in @var{bbtree} at the given @var{index}.
@var{index} must be a non--negative integer between @code{0} and @code{@var{size} - 1}, where
